# Holidaze | Project-Exam-2

## Description

This is my final project exam for the two year degree in frontend-development at Noroff school of vocational. The assigment was to create a site for the fictitious accommodation booking site called Holidaze. I buildt the frontend based on an API that was provided. You can find the api documentation [here](https://docs.noroff.dev/holidaze/authentication)

The site was to be created with the following user stories:

* A user may view a list of Venues
* A user may search for a specific Venue
* A user may view a specific Venue page by id
* A user may view a calendar with available dates for a Venue
* A user with a stud.noroff.no email may register as a customer
* A registered customer may create a booking at a Venue
* A registered customer may view their upcoming bookings
* A user with a stud.noroff.no email may register as a Venue manager
* A registered Venue manager may create a Venue
* A registered Venue manager may update a Venue they manage
* A registered Venue manager may delete a Venue they manage
* A registered Venue manager may view bookings for a Venue they manage
* A registered user may login
* A registered user may update their avatar
* A registered user may logout

## Known issues
* Although the individual unit tests functioned as expected, I encountered difficulties ensuring the correct configuration for their execution. The issue appears to not be rooted in the tests themselves, but rather in the setup and configuration aspects. No problems where detected for the e2e-tests. 

## Future improvments
* The design for desktop interfaces in this project could benefit from further enhancements. This project was primarily developed with a mobile-first approach, which, while ensuring an optimized mobile experience, may have inadvertently impacted the desktop design aesthetics. I acknowledge there's room for improvement in this area for a more balanced user experience across all platforms.
